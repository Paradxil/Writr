      <h3>How it Works</h3>
      <p>Write stories together, one line at a time!</p>
      <p>Add a new line to existing stories. You can't add more than one line to a story at a time encouraging everyone to take turns creating literary works.</p>
      <p>Have a great idea? Start your own story by writing the first line.</p>
      <p>Follow your favorite stories to see how they evolve.</p>
